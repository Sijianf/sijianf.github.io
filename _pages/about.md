My name is 范思键 (Fàn Sī Jiàn). I am currently a Ph.D. student in Statistics at the University of South Carolina, advised by Dr. [Ray Bai](https://raybai.net/). Before that, I obtained my M.S. degree in Biostatistics from Emory University where I was advised by Dr. [Benjamin Risk](https://thebrisklab.org/), and my B.S. degree in Applied Bioscience from Zhejiang University.

My research focuses on Bayesian statistical learning and optimization for high-dimensional structured data, with an emphasis on biclustering and inductive matrix completion. I am also interested in developing scalable algorithms in computational biology and biomedical data analysis with strong theoretical guarantees. If you would like to contact me, please feel free to reach out.
